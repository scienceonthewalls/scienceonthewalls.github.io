Our vision centres on empowering children to understand their bodies, appreciate nutritious foods, and find joy in movement. Rather than lecturing about 'healthy choices,' we're hoping to collaborate with local chefs and dance choreographers. Scientific concepts we shall explore are motor coordination, the structure of food (e.g., fats and proteins), and food reactions!
